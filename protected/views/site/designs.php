        <h1>Design 1 - Tree with Leaves and birds saying something</h1>
        <ul>
            <li class="bold">This is a responsive design (all-device-friendly). Fundamental features that Seth came up with are:</li>
            <li>Bird has a saying/training philosophy that can be shared (via FB,twitter,Google+ etc), marketing aspect to get the word out.</li>
            <li>That's why you see every bird is saying something.</li>
            <li>Mega-menu at the bottom - heavy navigation inspired by mindtools, where you have a sophisticated yet compact navigation.</li>
            <li>All the links - that will either direct to different pages OR.</li>
            <li>Another way is - the top-right navigation links can also bring you down, basically having entire sitemap on the front page in the footer.
                this is kinda in-thing in the world of responsive design.</li>

        <h1>Design 2 - Buffaloes concept</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Seth tried to take your idea of Buffalo, depecting the idea of "drab/mundane life (Buffaloes) being transformed/colorized by your funky olive birds, cuz they are cool?</li>
            <li>It kinda summarizes the idea of Design 1, in a differnt way.</li>

        <h1>Design 3 - Depicting a concept by showing metaphorical stages</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilizing your egg idea? Idea of orchestrating the content around these different stages, so that people can orient themselves, where they are in their development (personal/professional)</li>
            <li>Egg on the upper right (very tiny), gives options to change look on the page, changing stages to something else, like 4 other images that symbolizes 4 other things? or we can have something else developed around this idea of 4 stages or 4-something?
                (you can give in your input - ofcourse!!)</li>

        <h1>Design 4 - Talking about 4-key featured/hit/popular content on the site</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Top right menu will bring user down to each of the 4 sections associated with it</li>
            <li>Its More of structure than actual mockup - just so that you can fill in by running your creative imagination (provided you liked this concept for your homepage?)</li>
            <li>Its oriented around different infographics, say 4-main training types, and each one has a different description, and you can share each of these by clicking on option button?</li>

        <h1>Design 5 - Slideshow at the top and some extra info at the bottom</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Its a different way of orienting information, like a slideshow at the top? and browse through.</li>
            <li>It Has links, this is a grid that has 6 diff images, that shows 6 diff types of training/content.
                clicking on them would ideally take the user to a to diff training on that page?</li>
            <li>Top right menu will bring user down to each of the 4 sections associated with it</li>

        <ul>
            <li>This is a bit more compact. this is like desktop view, and on phone, the bottom 4 birds can stack on top of eachother.</li>
